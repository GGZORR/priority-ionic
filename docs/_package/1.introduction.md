## Overview

The motivation of Prioirty Ionic is providing an easy and generic mobile library on top of Priority's Web SDK.

Priority Ionic is made of different types of building blocks such as services, components, popup handlers and more. All interact togehter and exported as the `PriorityIonicModule`.

**Services** - services are provided for all the Priority Web SDK methods and entities, such as the Form and Procedure. They stand as high-level api's with addition of other important functionalities. The services, also could be called data-services, are singletones provided at the module level so data could be shared between all components.

**Components** - high-level components are provided to display and interact with the Priority Web SDK's entities. They interface as Ionic UI components with additional logic adjusted to Priority's data structure. The components are better defined as 'smart' components, because they interact diretly with the data services mentioned above.
